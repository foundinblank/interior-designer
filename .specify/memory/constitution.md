# Interior Designer Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Feature-First Design
Every feature begins with user scenarios and acceptance criteria; Implementation follows clear requirements and measurable success criteria; No technical implementation without validated user need and testing strategy.

### II. Specification-Driven Development
All features require formal specifications before implementation; Specifications include user stories, requirements, success criteria, and implementation plans; Code must align with approved specifications and pass defined acceptance tests.

### III. Test-First Implementation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced; All user stories must be independently testable with clear acceptance scenarios.

### IV. Independent Story Delivery
Each user story must be implementable, testable, and deployable independently; Stories should deliver standalone value as potential MVPs; No cross-story dependencies that break independent validation.

### V. Quality Gates
All code must pass linting, type checking, and automated tests before merge; Constitution compliance required for all implementations; Performance and security standards must be met for production deployment.

## Quality Standards

Code quality maintained through automated tooling and peer review; Documentation required for all public APIs and user-facing features; Error handling and logging implemented for all user interactions; Security best practices enforced throughout the development lifecycle.

## Development Workflow

All changes follow the Specify framework process: specification → planning → implementation → testing; Branch naming follows pattern: ###-feature-name; Pull requests require specification link, constitution check, and test validation; No direct commits to main branch without proper review process.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other development practices; All PRs and reviews must verify compliance with core principles; Complexity additions require explicit justification in implementation plans; Amendments require documentation, approval, and migration plan for existing code.
