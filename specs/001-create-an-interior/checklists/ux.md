## Summary

**Total Items**: 92
**Traceability**: 35% with spec references | 65% gap identification
**Focus Areas**:
- ✅ Keyboard navigation + Visual accessibility (Low-Vision emphasis)
- ✅ Zero-State scenarios
- ✅ Motion/Animation requirements
- ✅ Standard depth (balanced validation)

**Next Steps**:
1. Review each checklist item against spec.md and plan.md
2. Mark items as complete when requirements are found and validated
3. For incomplete items, add requirements to spec or document as intentional exclusions
4. Update spec sections with specific UX requirements where gaps exist
5. Re-run accessibility audit after addressing CHK041-CHK050 (Low-Vision focus items)

**Key Risk Areas Identified**:
- 🔴 **High Priority**: CHK041-CHK050 (Accessibility/Low-Vision) - Many gaps in WCAG compliance requirements
- 🔴 **High Priority**: CHK033-CHK040 (Keyboard Navigation) - Implementation plan exists but requirements lack specificity
- 🟡 **Medium Priority**: CHK058-CHK065 (Motion/Animation) - Completely undefined in requirements
- 🟡 **Medium Priority**: CHK051-CHK057 (Zero-State) - Edge cases identified but requirements missing

**Recommendation**: Address High Priority gaps before implementation begins to ensure accessibility compliance.
