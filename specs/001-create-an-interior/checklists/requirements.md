# Specification Quality Checklist: Interior Style Discovery App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality criteria met

### Summary
- All 16 checklist items passed validation
- 1 clarification question resolved (progress indicator behavior)
- 19 functional requirements defined
- 8 success criteria with measurable outcomes
- 3 prioritized user stories with acceptance scenarios
- 7 edge cases identified
- 10 documented assumptions

### Key Decisions
1. **Progress Indicator**: System will show estimated rounds remaining based on confidence calculation (e.g., "About 3-5 more rounds") rather than fixed ranges or just current round number

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- All mandatory sections are complete and validated
- No blocking issues or unresolved clarifications remain
