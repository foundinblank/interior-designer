# Feature Specification: Interior Style Discovery App

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-an-interior`
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create an interior designer app that will help me zero in on a specific decorative style or approach for my living room. I am terrible at this. Help me pick colors and styles that I'd grow to love. It should present me with two random images of living room decorations or colors and then tells me to pick A or B and then asks me why I picked either, then keeps going until the recommendation engine is able to zero in on a specific style that I love, and then presents me with 10 examples of that style and confirms if they're on the right track"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-14

- Q: User authentication & data privacy model? → A: No authentication - fully anonymous sessions, no data saved between browser sessions
- Q: Recommendation rejection flow behavior? → A: Both B and C - offer user choice to restart OR see alternative styles
- Q: Image loading failure handling? → A: Retry loading 2-3 times, then show placeholder images with "retry" button if still failing
- Q: Explanation validation rules? → A: Moderate validation: require at least 10 characters, allow any content (including vague responses)
- Q: Handling user indecision (can't choose A or B)? → A: Force selection - user must choose one option before proceeding (no skip allowed)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Binary Choice Discovery (Priority: P1)

A user unsure about their living room style preferences launches the app and is presented with two living room images side-by-side. They select their preferred option (A or B), explain why they chose it, and continue this process through multiple rounds. After several rounds, the system identifies their preferred style and presents confirmation examples.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the app - helping users discover their style preferences through guided, iterative choices. Without this, there is no MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by launching the app, making a series of binary choices with explanations, and verifying that a style recommendation is generated after sufficient rounds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user opens the app for the first time, **When** the main screen loads, **Then** two different living room images are displayed side-by-side with clear "A" and "B" labels
2. **Given** two images are displayed, **When** user selects option A, **Then** a prompt appears asking "Why did you choose A?"
3. **Given** user has explained their choice, **When** they submit the explanation, **Then** a new pair of images appears for the next round
4. **Given** user has completed multiple rounds of choices, **When** the system determines it has sufficient data to make a recommendation, **Then** the discovery phase ends and recommendations are presented
5. **Given** user is viewing a pair of images, **When** images load, **Then** both images are fully visible and clearly distinguishable before selection is enabled
6. **Given** an image fails to load after 2-3 automatic retry attempts, **When** the failure is detected, **Then** a placeholder image with a "retry" button is displayed, allowing the session to continue
7. **Given** a placeholder image is displayed, **When** user clicks the "retry" button, **Then** the system attempts to reload the actual image
8. **Given** user provides an explanation with fewer than 10 characters, **When** they attempt to submit, **Then** system displays validation message requiring at least 10 characters
9. **Given** user provides an explanation with 10+ characters (including vague responses), **When** they submit, **Then** system accepts the explanation and proceeds to next round
10. **Given** user is viewing image pair options A and B, **When** attempting to proceed without making a selection, **Then** system requires selection of either A or B (no skip option available)

### User Story 2 - Style Confirmation (Priority: P2)

After the system identifies a potential style match, the user is shown 10 examples of that style. They can review these examples and confirm whether the recommendations match their preferences, or indicate the system needs to refine further.

**Why this priority**: This validates the recommendation engine's accuracy and builds user confidence. It's dependent on P1 but adds critical feedback to ensure recommendations are accurate.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating completion of the discovery phase, then verifying that exactly 10 style-consistent examples are displayed with clear confirmation options.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the discovery phase has completed, **When** the recommendation screen loads, **Then** exactly 10 images representing the identified style are displayed
2. **Given** 10 recommendation images are displayed, **When** user views the images, **Then** a clear confirmation prompt asks "Are we on the right track?"
3. **Given** user is viewing recommendations, **When** user confirms the style is correct, **Then** a success message confirms the style match and displays the final recommendations (no persistence across sessions)
4. **Given** user is viewing recommendations, **When** user indicates the recommendations are not quite right, **Then** system presents two options: (1) view alternative style recommendations based on second-best match, or (2) restart discovery process from beginning
5. **Given** 10 recommendations are shown, **When** the screen loads, **Then** all images clearly represent a cohesive style theme
6. **Given** user chose to view alternative styles, **When** alternatives load, **Then** 10 new images representing the second-best matching style are displayed
7. **Given** user chose to restart, **When** restart is confirmed, **Then** session data is cleared and user returns to round 1 with a fresh image pair

---

### User Story 3 - Mid-Session Progress (Priority: P3)

During the discovery process, users can see how many rounds they've completed and get a sense of how close they are to receiving a recommendation, helping them understand the process isn't endless.

**Why this priority**: This improves user experience by setting expectations and reducing anxiety about process length, but isn't critical for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by making choices and verifying that progress indicators update appropriately after each round.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is in the discovery phase, **When** viewing any pair of images, **Then** a progress indicator shows current round number
2. **Given** user has completed a round, **When** the next pair loads, **Then** the progress indicator increments by one
3. **Given** user is nearing recommendation readiness, **When** the system calculates confidence level, **Then** an estimated range of remaining rounds is displayed (e.g., "About 3-5 more rounds")

### Edge Cases

- **Image loading failure**: System retries 2-3 times automatically; if still failing, displays placeholder image with manual "retry" button to allow session continuation
- **Vague or unhelpful explanations**: System accepts any text with 10+ characters, including vague responses like "idk I just like it" (algorithm will handle low-quality input gracefully)
- **Mid-discovery restart**: User can restart at any time via a confirmation modal; system clears session data and returns to round 1 with fresh image pair (see FR-024, FR-025)
- **User indecision between A and B**: No skip option provided; user must select either A or B to proceed (forced choice design)
- **Low confidence after max rounds**: If after 15 rounds the system cannot achieve confident recommendation threshold, it generates best-guess recommendations based on highest-scoring style (graceful degradation)
- **Ensuring image distinctiveness**: Image selection algorithm ensures each pair differs by at least 3 style attributes (primaryStyle, colors, or furniture tags) to elicit meaningful preferences
- **User rejects initial recommendations**: System offers two choices - view alternative style (second-best match) or restart from round 1
- **Double rejection (primary + alternative)**: If user rejects both recommendations, system displays a fallback message: "Let's try again! Your preferences may be evolving." and offers restart option only (no third alternative shown)

## Assumptions

1. **Image Library**: Assume a curated library of living room images is available, pre-tagged with style attributes (modern, traditional, minimalist, bohemian, industrial, etc.) and characteristics (color palette, furniture style, decorative elements)

2. **Recommendation Algorithm**: Assume the system uses a weighted scoring algorithm that analyzes:
   - Frequency of style attribute selection
   - Sentiment and keywords from user explanations
   - Consistency of choices over multiple rounds

3. **Minimum Rounds**: Assume minimum of 6 rounds needed before system can make a recommendation, with a maximum of 15 rounds before forcing a best-guess recommendation

4. **Platform**: Assume this is a web-based or mobile app with visual display capabilities (not voice-only or text-only interface)

5. **User Input**: Assume users can type explanations using a standard keyboard/touchscreen interface

6. **Image Sourcing**: Assume images are either licensed stock photos, user-generated content with permissions, or AI-generated images - legal rights are handled separately

7. **Single User**: Assume each session is for a single user making decisions about their own living room (not collaborative decision-making)

8. **Style Taxonomy**: Assume industry-standard interior design style categories exist and can be clearly defined (e.g., Modern, Mid-Century Modern, Scandinavian, Industrial, Bohemian, Traditional, Contemporary, Minimalist, Farmhouse, etc.)

9. **Language**: Assume primary language is English for explanations and interface text

10. **Session Scope**: Assume sessions are ephemeral and browser-based only (no cross-session persistence, no authentication, no long-term data storage); users must complete discovery in a single browser session
